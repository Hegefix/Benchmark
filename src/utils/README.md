# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helpers used throughout the app.

## Purpose

Utility functions are shared across multiple components and screens. They should be:
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Well-tested
- Reusable
- Type-safe

## Examples

- Date formatting functions
- String manipulation helpers
- Validation utilities
- Data transformation functions

## Adding New Utils

1. Create a new file with a descriptive name (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
2. Export the function(s) from the file
3. Add tests in `__tests__/` folder
4. Document with JSDoc comments
